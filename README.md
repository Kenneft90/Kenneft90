## Hello! 

I am a research officer working in the Sarawak Infectious Disease Centre. 

I have a decade-worth of background in molecular biology 🧬 and am venturing into epidemiology, genomics, and data science in my new role. 

I use R a lot at work and eager to learn about the Python language.

Machine learning has always been in the back of my head. I attend courses now and then, yet to find an use case to apply my novice skills.  

My favourite sport is basketball 🏀, favourite game is Pokemon Crystal 💎, and favourite animal is horse 🐴.
